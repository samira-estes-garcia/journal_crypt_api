# Journal Crypt API

## A Rails Application

Journal Crypt uses a Rails backend and a React front end. It allows users to create journal entries that only they can access. They can edit or delete their entries, and will soon have the option to encrypt each entry.

## Installation

- Clone this repo down as well as the frontend [Journal Crypt Client](https://github.com/samira-estes-garcia/journal_crypt_client)
- run bundle install
- run rails db:create, rails db:migrate, rails db:seed
- To start both servers run: foreman start -f Procfile.dev
